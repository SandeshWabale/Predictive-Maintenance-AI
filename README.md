**NeuralPulse** is a cutting-edge **Machine Failure Prediction System** designed to minimize industrial downtime. Built using **Python (Streamlit)** and powered by **Machine Learning**, it predicts potential equipment failures in real-time based on sensor data (Temperature, RPM, Pressure, etc.).

The UI was conceptually designed using **Google Stitch** to ensure a professional, industrial-grade aesthetic.

## ✨ Key Features

* **🧠 Advanced ML Integration:** Uses trained Logistic Regression/KNN models to predict failure probability with high accuracy.
* **🎨 Industrial UI Design:** Custom dark-mode interface with Glassmorphism effects, inspired by **Google Stitch** designs.
* **🔐 Secure Authentication:** Role-based login system for Operators and Managers (Supports Registration & Login).
* **📈 Real-Time Analytics:** Interactive line charts for sensor data (Temperature, Vibration, Torque).
* **⚠️ Smart Alerts:** Automatic flagging of critical failures with color-coded probability indicators (Red for Danger, Green for Safe).
* **📝 Audit History:** Exportable logs (CSV) of all machine predictions for maintenance review.
